Make your own badges [here][badges]! (Quick guide: `https://img.shields.io/badge/left-right-f39f37.svg`.)

## Solving the problem
Many GitHub repositories sport badges for things like:

As you can see from the zoomed 400% versions of these badges above, nobody is (really) using the same badge file and at normal size, they're hardly legible. Worst of all, they're completely inconsistent. The information provided isn't of the same kind on each badge. The context is blurry, which doesn't make for a straightforward understanding of how these badges are relevant to the project they're attached to and what information they provide.

## The Shields solution
As you can see below, without increasing the footprint of these badges, I've tried to increase legibility and coherence, removing useless text to decrease the horizontal length in the (likely) scenario that more of these badge thingies crop up on READMEs all across the land.
